  QUESTION 3.3:
    I expected higher quantas to make the execution faster but after several trials I don't notice an obvious difference. 
    I think this is maily due to the fact that the "real" operating system (e.g. Mac OS) still performs context switches while I'm running mykernel.
    This makes any potential difference in execution time almost unnoticeable.
