A makefile is provided with the project.
Use make or make all to compile everything.
Use make clean-o to remove .o files.
Use make clean to remove .o files and the executable mykernel.

Due to ambiguities in the expected behaviour of the OS, I interpreted openFiles() to allocates 10 contiguous blocks to the file and resets current_location to 0.

Format of the fat entries in the partition: name file_length current_location blockPtrs

Some terminals autoclose the brackets and this cause the write command to not work. If this happens please type the command in a text editor and then paste it in the terminal. 


Have a nice day :)
